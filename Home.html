                <h2 id="Bitcoin1.0">Addressing the why for Bitcoin 1.0</h2>
                <P class="Date"> <sup>21<sup class="Suptext">st</sup> August 2021 (Written in December/Jan) </sup></P>
            
                
                
                
                <p class="MsoNormal">Many have covered this topic, either quite extensively with
                great depth or with rather scant outlining, however, the true, collective
                understanding as displayed through trending ideas and sentiment seems to follow
                rational more emblematic of the latter. This is by no means a critique of the
                community; the concepts involved are difficult and exciting narratives or memes
                will always gain the most traction. The purpose of this therefore, is to
                provide enough depth to see through the noise, and present <i>Bitcoin’s need</i>
                not as an investment, trading asset or digital currency, but as sound money. And
                the truest form of sound money existing today, outclassing gold. We’ll look first
                at money and then at Bitcoin, addressing why this new technology is far more
                important, necessary and valuable beyond general understanding. </p>
                
                
                
                <p class="MiniTitle"><u>Understanding Bitcoin as sound money first requires an
                understanding of sound money.<o:p></o:p></u></p>
                
              
                
                <p class="MsoNormal">Money holds paramount importance in the functioning, growth and
                sustainability of any healthy society. Money, for any complex society, could
                even be considered a prerequisite. We see this when picturing an early human
                world before money, a world under the barter system**. A barter
                system as a means of exchange is socially restrictive, permitting the double coincidence
                of wants. Where any good, can only be exchanged when the other party wants that
                good and happens to offer something our seller wants in return. The problem of
                divisibility also occurs here. Consider a trade where the double coincidence of
                wants is met, and our two parties are looking to trade a specially crafted spear
                for apples (our hunter has had a bad week). The spear is far more valuable than
                the apples and since it cannot be subdivided without being destroyed, a
                satisfactory exchange might be impossible to occur; more apples beyond a
                certain point ≠ more value. It follows that this exchange will only take place
                when the immediate desire for a meal (apples) becomes greater than the value of
                a tool for procuring food, to a hunter nonetheless, which could be at the point
                of starvation.</p>
                
                <p class="MsoNormal">Here we can see that in order to further specialise and
                divide labour, barter is not suitable. And when specialising, dividing labour
                and working together is the key to the growth of complex society, the
                participants, as our early humans did, will <i class="Naturally">naturally</i> pivot to a means
                of exchange to facilitate trade. The early and first intermediaries for trade
                being shells and stones among others is quite thoroughly explored by <a href="https://nakamotoinstitute.org/shelling-out/"><span style="text-decoration:
                none;text-underline:none">Nick Szabo</span></a>.</p>
                
              
                
                <p class="MsoNormal">With the idea that an intermediary for trade must exist as a
                foundational element for societal growth, we can now look at what that
                intermediary should ideally be. Or, what money should be and what naturally
                constitutes sound money. It will thus be helpful to look at markets and see
                what can naturally occur. We shall call our generalised market the ‘Earl Market’,
                as it consists of early humans who only trade with commodities (basic goods) at
                this point. In looking at this market we will recognise how gold, became the
                world’s chosen intermediary and chosen form of money. </p>
                
               
                
                <p class="MsoNormal">In the Earl Market, participants can trade anything they
                produce or acquire. We soon find that certain commodities will have an
                increased demand due to their relative scarcity. More people will be willing to
                trade their goods for a rare, distinctive precious metal like gold than for seashells.
                Because of this, the owners of such goods will find it easier in the market to
                obtain what they truly want whether that be food, materials, garments etc. Those
                who do not have such goods, highly tradeable goods, and have illiquid goods
                instead, will look to trade not for their wants/needs, but to come under possession
                of commodities more tradeable. To thereby help them get to their wants/needs
                more easily. It follows that commodities in this market, are not only worth
                their value to any given individual, but the tradability of a good will add to
                its value, as any owner will always be closer to acquiring what they truly
                want/need. Extending this market through time and to other markets far and wide,
                our participants will also consider the portability and durability of any goods
                they may wish to acquire, ensuring future needs/want can be met regardless of
                geography. Increasing the value of durability and transportability for tradable
                goods.</p>
                
                <p class="MsoNormal">At first, only a limited number of participants will
                discover the value in a commodity that will always bring them closer to
                acquiring whichever good they want/need. But any such good, as more
                participants realise its value beyond intrinsic qualities and instead in what
                others and they themselves can gain in <i>function</i> from these qualities,
                will become widely accepted. Widely accepted for its function in tradability as
                well as its function as a store of value for future trade. As more people use the
                commodity, more others will realise why they too should be using the commodity.
                Human history has seen many tested commodities: shells, stones and even rice,
                yet gold and other precious metals were naturally found to have the best suited
                qualities for money all over the world. This gradual genesis of a medium of
                exchange, as best written in Carl Menger’s ‘On the Origins of Money’ is how we
                can understand gold becoming the de facto commodity of the Earl Market and that
                of the human world. And to close with a direct quote.</p>

                authority chose gold; the market did. Showing, the counterintuitive notion,
                that money, will naturally arise in the free market as a commodity. And while
                it isn’t used as a direct means of exchange today, as sound money, gold still
                holds value. The qualities needed for sound money as displayed through the
                emergence of gold are: fungibility (interchangeable because they are
                identical), divisibility, recognisability, scarcity, portability and
                durability. And through these qualities we see how sound money can and by
                definition, functions as a medium of exchange, store of value and furthermore a
                unit of account. These qualities and functions define sound money,

                <p class="MsoNormal">The meaning of money has been perverted through history.
                Hence the need to differentiate between fiat and sound. However, a general
                definition can be understood as follows. Money is the title we give to any
                instrument commonly used as: a store of value, means of exchange and unit of
                account. Defining money through its functions. The key aspect of this
                definition however, is that any instrument can <i>hold the title</i> of money,
                if used for these functions. However, said instrument may not necessarily
                possess the qualities needed for these functions, as seen in gold, and can
                therefore lose the <i>title</i> of money. </p>
                
                <p class="MsoNormal">Made especially evident in room 68 of The British Museum, a
                graveyard of sorts for all the historic instruments that have lost their title
                of money after losing value (As highlighted in The Hidden secrets of money by
                Mike Maloney). Gold, having been found through the market for having specific
                qualities, still holds value and function as money centuries later. The
                significant difference between gold and any room 68 inhabitant, is that use was
                never induced by a central authority. Every single currency, given its title of
                money through a central authority (fiat money), will become worthless through
                manipulation by that central authority. Consequently, we must come to accept,
                the fiat currencies, holding the title of money today, are all feeling the
                gradual yet certain pull of room 68. Somewhere along the way, centrally issued currencies
                lose integral qualities as compared to gold and henceforth, fail to fulfil the
                functions needed of money. </p>
                
                <p class="MsoNormal">Now then, why and where does this happen? And could this
                time be different? To understand why this happens we will continue our brief
                history of money production and spot why centrally issued currencies are
                consistently doomed to retirement within room 68.</p>
                
              
                
                <p class="MsoNormal">Once gold, amongst other precious metals were in use,
                centralised, <i>trusted</i> actors were then able to step in and help stabilise
                the process of trade and offset limits to gold through processes such as
                coinage. Imprinting the metal with certification of weight and denoting a worth
                for exchange. This helps alleviate the need for people to weigh their own
                metals in providing function as a unit of account and increases the convenience
                of sound money. This process, therefore, adds to the value of certified coins
                in comparison to the raw metals, giving the minter profits for their efforts.
                When the process of certification can create value, we can see that the
                certificates themselves can be used without a necessary integration with the
                metal it represents. Alongside the fact that larger scale transport and storage
                of gold can prove inefficient as economies grow, a reason for central storage
                and ‘substitute money’ can be seen. With central authorities involved for
                minting (mainly governments), and banking (storing gold deposits and issuing
                money substitutes), we can see where our first distortions will occur. </p>
                
               
                
                <p class="MsoNormal">This is by no means a complete account; we needn’t go over
                the debasement of coins and episodes of hyperinflation around Ancient Rome.
                Here, the video series <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLE88E9ICdiphYjJkeeLL2O09eJoC8r7Dc"><span style="text-decoration:none;text-underline:none">Hidden secrets of money</span></a>
                gives a highly engaging outline amongst other teachings. The most important
                takeaway here is that governments will never fail to debase currency and
                artificially increase the supply. Using this extra currency to pay for
                extravagancies (particularly war) it couldn’t otherwise afford through taxation
                alone. However, since debasement of coins can be slow and limited, governments
                found better ways to inflate the money supply by cooperating with fractional
                reserve banks. A couple of definitions can be helpful here.</p>
                
                <p ><ul><li>

                >Inflation in this context means “An extension of
                the nominal quantity of any medium of exchange beyond the quantity that would
                have been produced on the free market” as defined in The Ethics of money
                production by <span class="SpellE">Jörg</span> Guido <span class="SpellE">Hülsmann</span>.
                Which goes on to give the more present-day definition too “A lasting increase
                of the price level…/ reduction of the purchasing power of money”. Through this
                definition we can see the negative impact of inflation on savings and on those
                who hold the inflated currency.</li> 

              <li>
               >Fractional reserve banking is the practice of
                banks holding only a portion of customer deposits in relation to notes issued
                representing those deposits; to allow for increased lending and an ‘expansion
                of the economy’. The increased lending however is what grants the bank
                additional profits beyond what could be achieved through reserves alone.</li></ul></p>
            
                
                
                
                <p class="MsoNormal">The process of moving to fiat, from notes that represent
                quantities of gold (hence the names pound, mark, franc) can now be summarised
                as follows. The government will first establish a monopoly on precious metals,
                quashing their use as a means of exchange. Then grant legal tender status to
                the ‘money substitutes’ or notes of a privileged fractional reserve bank (the
                bank of the government, to later become a ‘central bank’). Legal tender status
                means that the notes must be accepted regardless of any former contracts
                (contracts where gold is owed). Establishing a national currency through law and
                ending the issuance of private currencies. These now overvalued notes, will
                further drive the undervalued money out. People will trade with and circulate
                the ‘bad money’ and hoard any ‘good money’, known as Gresham’s Law. At this
                point, people are using their national, central banks legal tender notes that
                represent gold only fractionally reserved. Eventually this privileged bank will
                be allowed to indefinitely decline redemption of the sound money that these
                notes were formerly representing (‘a removal from the gold standard’) in a suspension
                of payments. Hereby making paper money or fiat. As this monetary system now
                stands, this privileged bank can effectively produce/print money at no cost at
                the will of government by providing them loans backed by nothing; it’s just
                paper that only has value while citizens accept it. This process works to
                create a system where governments, through central banks, can create currency
                for themselves to the detriment of people using the currency. This last
                happened in 1971 when the US dollar, the <i>worlds </i>reserve currency was
                made to be no longer redeemable in gold. This process of paper money production

                <p class="MsoNormal">Now to close this segment with some key followings. Once
                money becomes fiat, it can be created at will, hence the explosion of
                government debt. This excessive creation of fiat, removes the scarce quality
                needed for sound money. If it can be made at no cost, and profits those in
                control, it will soon be worth less than the paper it’s printed on. This system
                only lasts as long as people are willing to continue with the lie that their currency
                has any lasting value. As currency devalues, people will begin to need more for
                the goods and services they provide, our modern definition of inflation. Think
                of rising prices for household goods over the years. This increase will happen
                exponentially until prices are going up so fast that currency not spent today,
                is currency lost tomorrow. When this happens, currencies are hyperinflating as
                they have done most recently in Zimbabwe and Venezuela. Destroying wealth and
                ruining livelihoods. Fiat currency requires full trust in the same institutions
                who profit from its creation at no immediate cost. This is because the true
                cost is offset to the population who unknowingly keep faith and savings in a
                continually debased form of money. With that in mind, you can count on your
                central bank and government to curtail this issue and ensure wealth isn’t
                destroyed, unlike failed empires and governments through history, which they
                might, or you can look to another solution. </p>
                
               
                
                <p class="MiniTitle"><u>Understanding Bitcoin as a form of sound money<o:p></o:p></u></p>
                
                
                
                <p class="MsoNormal">Bitcoin is complicated, however it is no more complicated
                than money itself. And if you understand enough about money to see any issue
                today, you can easily understand enough about bitcoin to see it as a potential
                solution.</p>
                
               
                
                <p class="MsoNormal">Bitcoin has two meanings, most easily understood as a
                peer-to-peer electronic cash system, and a unit of exchange within the system.
                We’ll set up some context by way of the whitepaper. Published in 2008, the
                whitepaper was written by an anonymous individual or individuals by the name
                Satoshi Nakamoto. The project itself was then released as open-source software
                in early 2009. Hereby introducing the first key concept of Bitcoin,
                decentralisation. Being open source means that the code is openly available to
                anyone. This may seem like a security flaw, however this actually works to
                increase security and trust; we can always see exactly how it works and ensure
                its operability. Consider companies like Facebook, who through their business
                model and private codebase have come under scrutiny for shady advertising
                technology. If you can see exactly how it works, you can trust it. More so, you
                don’t need to trust anything because the technology is visible in the code.
                Open-source development works to pool resources from anyone with an interest in
                the project at hand. The best of open-source development leads to the growth of
                projects through sheer passion and world benefit without financial incentive. This
                worked for Linux, which quietly took over the world, and It may work for
                Bitcoin too as suggested in a Ted-talk by <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HrCKFd5vTpM"><span style="text-decoration:
                none;text-underline:none">Rusty Russel</span></a> on a history of Open-source. </p>
                
                <p class="MsoNormal">Having no identifiable creator/s means no centralised
                ownership and the project truly belongs to the people. Satoshi Nakamoto guided
                development for the first few years, while needed, and then disappeared in
                2011, giving way to a fully decentralised system for the world to build upon. </p>
                
               
                <p class="MsoNormal">We can already see how the decentralised nature, from
                conception differs to the inhabitants of room 68, now let’s look at the
                technology that makes Bitcoin. Moving on from the <a href="https://bitcoin.org/bitcoin.pdf"><span style="text-decoration:none;
                text-underline:none">whitepaper</span></a>, considered a technical paper, we’ll
                look to understand what makes Bitcoin pioneering. The first point to be made is
                that bitcoin solves a long-standing consensus problem which can be understood
                through the Byzantine generals’ problem. Many overlook the fact that Bitcoin is
                cutting-edge in this regard alone. The Byzantine generals’ problem involves a
                number of generals, separated geographically, trying to reach consensus on when
                to attack an enemy. If consensus cannot be met the attack fails. Despite
                omitting details here, in understanding the sense of the problem, <a href="https://blockchain.news/news/Why-the-proof-of-work-chain-is-a-solution-to-the-Byzantine-Generals'-Problem"><span style="text-decoration:none;text-underline:none">James A. Donald put it best</span></a>.
                </p>
                
                <p class="MsoNormal" align="center" style="text-align:center"><i>“It is not
                sufficient that everyone knows X. We also need everyone to know that everyone
                knows X, and that everyone knows that everyone knows that everyone knows X —
                which, as in the Byzantine Generals’ problem, is the classic hard problem of
                distributed data processing.”</i></p>
                
                <p class="MsoNormal">Without a solution to this problem, digital payment systems
                cannot exist without a trusted, centralised entity ensuring that no one spends
                the same money in multiple places (double spend) and thereby creates money
                through dishonest transactions. All parties need a way of knowing where the
                supply of money is, so that they can tell when money can be rightfully
                exchanged. Bitcoins solution to this problem, or its solution to double spend,
                allows it to provide peer-to-peer digital payments with any trusted party
                involved. </p>
                
                
                
                <p class="MsoNormal">Now, to understand exactly how bitcoin does this, and the
                interesting concepts within the core technology, much more writing would need
                to be dedicated as many new concepts must be introduced. Keeping things
                simpler, addressing some misunderstandings of Bitcoin can provide enough
                outline.</p>
                
                <p class="MsoNormal">The first instinctual question, that may arise for some is:
                what is tangible about bitcoin, how and where does it actually exist? </p>
                
                <p class="MsoNormal">The misunderstanding of bitcoin in this regard is often propagated
                by media depiction. You often see gold coins engraved with symbolic B’s, which
                are actually meaningless and misguided visualisations. A better means of
                understanding is through the word itself ‘Bit-coin’ with a bit being a basic unit
                of information. Rather than thinking about its presence through a coin, think
                about it as information. This information is stored publicly and held by
                everyone within the Bitcoin ecosystem. When you personally own Bitcoin, you’ll
                have a cryptographically generated password (private key) that gives you alone
                the ability to transact with another party and update the whole ecosystem to
                show that Bitcoin has been moved from one address (public key) to another. Or
                more rather that the general information has changed. This is done through a
                decentralised ledger technology called a blockchain and can therefore be more
                appropriately visualised through transactions-grouped-in-blocks-connected-by-a-strong-chain-in-a-public-ledger-of-information.
                The reliability of any new transaction comes from the fact that every
                transaction since the beginning is publicly stored allowing us to ensure that
                said Bitcoin is actually under the possession of the party transacting with it.
                It follows that if all your technology, personally used to deal with your
                Bitcoin were unfortunately destroyed, stolen or lost, the public ledger would
                still identify your Bitcoin as within your address. Consequently, with your
                private key, you could continue to transact from any new device.</p>
                
                <p class="MsoNormal">Another question that often arises is: what gives Bitcoin
                its value, since it doesn’t do anything how can it have value?</p>
                
                <p class="MsoNormal">Here we can look at the creation of new bitcoin, involving a
                process we call mining. Miners group transactions together (information
                updates) and compete to form the newest block to be cryptographically linked in
                the blockchain (the public ledger). The miners alongside nodes (Nodes will hold
                the entire blockchains information and validate transactions) are therefore
                sustaining the entire system, but not for free of course. It’s the first miner
                to show ‘proof of work’ and solve a cryptographic puzzle, that will publish the
                latest block and be rewarded a set amount of Bitcoin for their efforts. Proof
                of work requires a lot of energy, however being rewarded in bitcoin makes it
                profitable. The energy cost required from proof of work also makes it difficult
                to change a transaction once on the blockchain (beyond a few blocks). It’s
                worth noting that miners also get paid in transaction fees for the transactions
                they store.</p>
                
                <p class="MsoNormal">Now it still might be hard to grasp why Bitcoin has value,
                which is okay because there are some key ‘monetary policy’ elements we haven’t
                touched yet. Proof of work is difficulty adjusted, meaning no matter how strong
                mining computers get, or the number of miners competing, it will always take an
                average of 10 minutes for the next block to be mined generating new supply.
                This new supply, as rewarded to the miners halves every four years. Most
                importantly however, there is a limited supply of Bitcoin capped at 21 million
                to ever be mined. This makes Bitcoin scarce. Therefore, with around 18 million
                in circulation now, we can also see that the last Bitcoin will be mined some
                time around 2140, where miners will then get paid through transaction fees
                alone.</p>
                
                <p class="MsoNormal">While there may be no intrinsic value to Bitcoin like gold
                (nice to look at), it holds value by way of the cost needed for Bitcoin to
                exist and its limited supply. Not counting of course, the value given to it by
                the market.</p>
                
               
                
                <p class="MsoNormal">The qualities needed for sound money are all present within
                Bitcoin and actually surpass gold. It’s more easily divisible with the most
                important denomination being Satoshis/Sats at 0.00000001 bitcoin. Plus, it’s
                more easily portable with ownership being in the form of private keys
                (passwords). The constraints on those two qualities were the reasons for
                continual centralisation of gold in minting and in storage. In this regard
                Bitcoin reigns supreme as a more accessible and decentralised instrument of
                exchange and store of value. The one reigning quality of gold however, is an
                unyielding durability through time. Bitcoin has yet to prove itself in this
                regard however since it can also live <a href="https://en.bitcoin.se/articles/bitcoin-without-internet"><span style="text-decoration:none;text-underline:none">without the internet</span></a>
                (satellite, radio, SMS…) and is decentralised, destroying the ecosystem becomes
                unfeasible. </p>
                
                <p class="MsoNormal">The technology of Bitcoin is not only cutting-edge in the
                problems it solves, but in being born of the internet, it’s most aptly suited
                to the world we live in and future needs of money. With only 11 years Bitcoin
                is currently establishing itself as a store of value. Reputation as sound money
                is mostly held back through effort needed to understand it. However, as the
                price keeps rising and more people come to recognize the value in Bitcoin, more
                and more people will want ownership, as in the previous quote.</p>

                <p class="MiniTitle"><u>Bitcoin as it stands today<o:p></o:p></u></p>
                
                
                
                <p class="MsoNormal">It wouldn’t make sense to address the why of Bitcoin without
                looking at the why nots and common arguments against. One of this first, is on
                the wastefulness in the energy consumption used to mine Bitcoin. However, the
                externality incurred, in negative environmental effects, is exactly the same as
                that which powers modern society. The biggest difference being, this energy is
                used to create a decentralised financial system for the world to store value
                against failing centralised systems. Imagine if all the savings and real value
                lost in hyperinflation, such as in Zimbabwe, were transferred into Bitcoin. The
                net gain to humanity is far greater than plastic bags; this argument holds negligible
                weight. </p>
                
                
                
                <p class="MsoNormal">Another point, more valid however, is that Bitcoin is
                currently inefficient as a means of exchange, as when transactions get congested,
                fees balloon. This happens because there’s a limit to the number of
                transactions that can be mined in a single block and miners will prioritise
                transactions yielding higher fees. Bitcoin developers, as it’s an open-source
                development project, are currently working on solutions to this problem through
                the ‘lightning network’. Which proposes to add another layer for scalability.
                Any proprietor of this point, as an argument against Bitcoin, will almost
                always have some stake in the current financial system that is provably
                unsustainable. Choosing ignorance is not an argument; the growth of the Bitcoin
                community and wider community too, who believe and who work to <i>make</i>
                Satoshi Nakamoto’s vision reality, has been and continues to be the most
                bullish signal for future dominance. <span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;</span></p>
                
                
                
                <p class="MsoNormal">The volatility of Bitcoins price, with price action often
                being an introduction to Bitcoin, will deter some through the ideas that:
                Bitcoin cannot be a safe investment, the price is too speculative or that it’s
                a risk-on asset. If one thing is to be understood through this writing, it’s
                that Bitcoin should not be considered an investment but as a form of money
                itself. And a form of money still in its price discovery stage, where the
                market, that being the global population with access to the internet, is still
                trying to determine how valuable it is and what they are willing to trade for
                it. If the current global population of the internet decided they wanted to own
                some Bitcoin, that would be 5 billion people looking to trade for a max supply
                of 21 million Bitcoins (18 million already in circulation). It follows, that
                once Bitcoin has found a relative price, selling back into fiat could even be
                redundant. During price discovery, transacting with bitcoin can be risky as you
                may end up paying for the most expensive pizza in the world. As did Laszlo
                Hanyecz when he purchased two pizzas for 10,000 Bitcoin in 2010, which at the
                time of writing is worth $190,000,000. </p>
                
                <p class="MsoNormal">In considering where the price may go, people like to
                consider that if bitcoin had the current market cap of gold, the price for one
                would be around $380,000 - $480,000. This is of course just a rough calculation
                not counting how much the world could change between now and that point. </p>
                
                
                
                <p class="MsoNormal">One change that can be certain to occur rather soon, is
                increased regulation as governments worldwide react in some form or other, to
                that which cannot be controlled, provides sovereignty and destabilises control.
                Central bank digital currencies are being looked at worldwide, with adoption in
                The Bahamas and <a href="https://finance.sina.com.cn/blockchain/roll/2020-04-29/doc-iirczymi8965102.shtml"><span style="text-decoration:none;text-underline:none">China</span></a> being the
                farthest in rollout amongst major nations. The technologies used compared to
                Bitcoin however, are quite different and often vary. CBDC’S are really just
                attempts at extending and advancing monetary and fiscal policy as currencies
                collapse. Being attempts, they can easily fail and will need extreme changes to
                the world we live in (cash removal), in order to be adopted as intended. Further
                regulation cryptocurrencies themselves however, is surely coming, but it’s
                worth remembering that Bitcoin is decentralised and cannot be stopped itself.
                Most regulation will be around companies operating within the ecosystem.</p>
                
               
                
                <p class="MsoNormal">The true beauty in Bitcoin however, and why it reigns
                supreme above gold is that it takes into account the amount of change that occurs
                in the world we live in. Any roadblock in the adoption of Bitcoin becomes a
                problem to be solved through the open-source nature of its design. The
                cryptocurrency landscape ushered in by Bitcoin is rapidly growing with projects
                providing innovation in wide ranging fields. Consider Ethereum, currently
                seeing a lot of development in the burgeoning world of decentralised finance
                (DeFi), but at the same time, working to extend the ethos as brought to us by
                Satoshi Nakamoto. </p>
                
                <p class="MsoNormal">This is kind of technology that provides its most important
                function by changing the way the world thinks. Thanks to the vision of Bitcoin,
                through the internet, there is a global market for sound money. As a pioneering
                technology, and proof of concept, a replacement could <i>theoretically</i> be
                created tomorrow. However, when looking for a store of economic energy, there
                is a clear winner for the world. It’s the best form of sound money we’ve ever
                seen and it already belongs to you.</p>
                
                
                
                <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size:10.0pt">**While it is the prevailing
                idea as taught by most schools of economic thought, there isn’t much historical
                evidence of barter systems predating small-scale money systems. As presented in ‘The Myth of Barter’,

            <h2 id="Site1.0">Dipping my toes into Web Development with the creation of this Site 1.0</h2>
            <P class="Date"> <sup>3<sup class="Suptext">rd</sup> January 2021</sup></P>
            <p> 
                As soon as I realised I might end up creating a website, I started taking note of what I was
                doing. Initially, inspiration wasn’t web development per se, however my desire to learn
                JavaScript led to me dipping my toes into the WebDev world and here we are. Hooray... Since
                everything’s recorded and I have further plans for this site and my skills as a developer,
                writing up how I got here could prove valuable in the future. 
            </p>
            <p>
                I started with the <a href="https://www.theodinproject.com/" target="_blank">Odin Project</a> and it was from here I started learning the basics of HTML &amp;
                    CSS (literally all I know is basics right now) with the best secondary resources as discovered
                    through the Odin project, being <a href="https://learn.shayhowe.com/html-css/"target="_blank">Shayhowe.com</a> and <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/HTML" target="_blank">Mozilla Web Docs</a>.
            </p>
            <p>
                Once I reached the task of recreating the Google homepage as part of the Odin Project, I
decided to opt for something where I could display more of my own creative flair with the
new skills I had learnt. And since I have plans to write articles anyway, having recently
written ‘Addressing the Why for Bitcoin’ I thought a blog would do nicely.
            </p>
            <p>
                Thinking forward, as I intended this to be a Website I would in fact use, I didn’t like the idea
of having to edit the code every time I wanted to publish a new article. I don’t hardcode
tweets onto twitter; I log in, there’s a nice little section for tweeting and then I go spew
<a href="https://www.twitter.com/NicoUndefined/status/1345974143490154501" target="_blank"> foolishness</a>. Here I realised a CMS or content management system might be better for my
needs. Something like WordPress. However, since that would defeat the purpose of my
Web-Development project I decided to go along with the process only marginally jaded.
Focusing on styling and a framework for which more could be added.
            </p>
            <p>
                Starting with style I first wanted to create a dark website, black background white text.
However, the large majority of the Blogs I looked at for inspiration, the ones I read, were all
white and I wondered if there was any true benefit. And unsurprisingly <a href="https://www.toptal.com/designers/ui/dark-ui" target="_blank">Dark UI isn’t the best
choice when it comes to Blog-type content</a>. 
            </p>
            <p>
                Having lost more than half of my brand identity I started thinking about the design of my
blog and as I had learnt online decided to sketch it out on paper first. The name Un_Defined
came to me by way of divine intervention, as a perfect fit to replace my placeholder/typo of
UNdecided in my HTML.
            </p>
            <p>
                When it came to fleshing out the page two YouTube videos were particularly helpful. My
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oLgtucwjVII&amp%3Bt=123s" target="_blank">Nav-Bar</a> Master in addition to my <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=68O6eOGAGqA" target="_blank">responsive CSS Grid</a> God were my two angels, for without
them entering my life, I may well have regressed and created a mock-up Google Homepage
instead.
            </p>
            <p>
                Once the site was fully marked up and the styling had been added I looked for ways to
publish it. Through Mozilla Web Docs I learnt that you could actually do this <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8hrJ4oN1u_8" target="_blank"> through GitHub</a>,
which would be a perfect fit since I could populate my empty GitHub in the absence of a
Google Homepage replica.
            </p>
            <p>
                When you publish through GitHub pages your website must be static rather than dynamic.
In looking at the <a href="https://www.fasthosts.co.uk/blog/static-vs-dynamic-websites/" target="_blank">differences between Static and Dynamic</a>  websites I began to see the power
in Html and CSS and why writing it off for the use of CMS can only stem from ignorance.
Further plans for this site actually include developing it into the latter to add more
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_wFJj94kSTU" target="_blank">functionality and depth</a>.
            </p>
            <p>
                At this stage I wanted my own domain name rather than the bulky domain name as offered
                by GitHub. Seeing that you could <a href="http://www.curtismlarson.com/blog/2015/04/12/github-pages-google-domains/" target="_blank"> add your own domain name to your GitHub</a> hosted
                website was great and I eventually did this, not through google domains, but through the
                <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CpCgqUf94k&amp%3Bt=618s" target="_blank">first</a> few YouTube results’ favourite in <a href="https://www.dynadot.com/" target="_blank"> Dynadot</a>. ‘undefined.london’ was a nice find and was
                a good enough price in my opinion. ‘.com’ and the other favourites were taken but this
                works perfectly for now.  
            </p>
            <p>
                I was practically finished here, however I started to question the negatives to hosting with
GitHub; It seemed too good of a deal. In learning about some of the <a href="https://kevinsweet.com/pros-cons-github-pages" target="_blank"> downsides of control</a>,
speed, security, I realised they weren’t particularly impactful to me right now. The next
iteration of this site would solve these perhaps as I move off of GitHub and to a paid host.
            </p>
            <p>
                Speaking of, the 1.0 in the title is in no way meaningless I have full intention of adding to
and quite dramatically changing the way this site operates and furthermore, writing about
it. I will use this site and my desire to upgrade it, not only as incentive in becoming a full
stack developer but also as a vessel for the many ideas that require its growth from a static
Web blog hosted by GitHub to whatever mutation I’ve fathered in at 9.0.
            </p>
            <p>
                Next on The Odin Project for me: Rock, Paper, Scissors in JavaScript. Hooray...
            </p>

            <p> <strong>Edit:</strong>
                So unfortunately the site as I has had setup from this point was not running.
                I was getting this message when I believed I should be able to access it.
                Looking back at how to point a google domain to GitHub pages I realised I was missing the step
                involving any IP address (GitHub’s). And  as much as it brings pangs about mine heart
                the easiest way to rectify this issue was to cave in to Big Tech and use Google Domains
                just like the tutorial. However the DynaDot UI wasn’t half as clear or easy to use.
                Google Domains should’ve been a no-brainer maybe?
            </p>
            <div class="ErrorImgContainer">
            <img src="Images/ErrorImg.png" class="Errorimg">
            </div>
            <p>
                Also, when troubleshooting, <a href="https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/github/working-with-github-pages/managing-a-custom-domain-for-your-github-pages-site#configuring-a-subdomain" target="_blank">the GitHub Docs page</a> already had everything outlined. But I had overlooked it.
                The lesson learnt here being the documentation provided should probably be checked regardless of whether
                you believe you know what you’re doing or not. In this case I could’ve saved myself from unnecessarily
                buying undefined.london which I still own; I have no doubt overspent now. However since undefined.london
                is mine for the year and I prefer it to nicodeth.me, I might switch at some point with some more understanding.
            </p>
