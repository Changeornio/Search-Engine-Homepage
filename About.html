            <h2 class="MsoNormal" align="center" style="text-align:center">Un_Defined</h2>
                
               
                
                <p class="MsoNormal">There’s a kind of humour in the role of explaining my idea
                around the ‘Undefined’ Website, but I’m still working out the philosophy/my
                philosophy, so I won’t worry about it just yet. </p>
                
               
                
                <p class="MsoNormal">Article ideas are to be introduced primarily as ‘Addressing...’.
                Creating a place for that idea to be followed up successively in an enriching
                of the original idea and perspective on the topic. The more addressed, and the
                more thoroughly, the greater the would-be visualisation of the site as a
                physical space like a Town. To perhaps one day even be visualised in that
                sense, adding a clarity to how certain topics can intertwine and connect with each
                other in the sense of a dense and interwoven City.</p>
                
               
                
                <p class="MsoNormal">Given the way I think, I tend to make a lot of connections
                between the many things I see and learn. (In writing this I started looking for
                an article on how congenital blindness protects from schizophrenia, so as to
                recall how (as I read) certain minds, particularly those of “artists” (those
                who engage in abstracting a world understood through language to various other
                forms particularly visual) tend to make myriads of connections from
                external sources in what can amount to an increasingly hard to dissect and disseminate
                internal world. (Plus I also have different ideas, given personal experience, about what schizophrenia is)). This website serves to get some ideas down as best I can. Articulating
                experience and my inner construction of things as I can best research them. </p>
                
              
                
                <p class="MsoNormal">The quote from David Foster Wallace feels particularly relevant
                here</p>
                
               
                
                <p class="Quote" align="center" style="text-align:center">“How odd I can have
                all this inside me and to you it’s just words”</p>
                
                
                <p class="MsoNormal">And this is coming from someone who feels or lives with the
                presence of Remote Neural Monitoring technology. I guess it also applies to
                whoever is in my mind and making my body twitch accordingly too. </p>
                
             
                
                <p class="MsoNormal">Don’t expect to find any meaningful information on this site
                – it’s just a bunch of symbols on a screen. Anything meaningful comes from you. I cannot impart any disputed ideas onto you,
                especially those of the nature I am most(unfortunately(but not entirely I guess)) gravitated to.
                If anything, some ideas here may open you to thinking about things differently. Clinging to ideas 
                about the reality you've been fed, can be quite as insane as the definition of insanity itself.</p>
          
                
                <p class="MsoNormal">The Undefined aspect will be further explored as I learn
                more about the intuitive understanding of our world before our categorising of
                the world through language and over-thinking. Buddhism, Religion, linguistics, mathematics, spirituality...
                idk it’s there somewhere. The notion can be understood, or articulated as best
                by me right now as going on 'Reality TV singing show x' as the ‘Builder who lost their confidence
                in a teenage car crash’. You go through the sob story every week as it becomes
                the defining element of you, diluting you into to a narrative. More easily digestible,
                and saleable too for the commercial and institutional interests who expend you.
                With yourself invisibly or perhaps visibly defining yourself alike. This idea
                applies to us as we live our regular lives too. Awash in definitions and characterisations
                that don’t really mean anything. That don't truly define us. </p>
                
                <p class="MsoNormal">Trying to undefine myself rather than understand myself (Our
                object/means of understanding through life are skewed and my personal object/means
                of understanding is even moreso...).</p>
